# DDD-CQRS-ES
Sample Application of DDD-CQRS-ES principles.

MicroService Anagrafiche to manage "Articoli" and "Clienti"
MicroService OrdiniClienti to manage "Customers Order".
EventsDispatcher to dispatch events from EventStore.

To publish and receive events in this solution I used Paramore.Brighter library by Ian Cooper.

Thanks to Iridio (Alessandro Colla) for his support with CommonDomain.

To run th sample please install
